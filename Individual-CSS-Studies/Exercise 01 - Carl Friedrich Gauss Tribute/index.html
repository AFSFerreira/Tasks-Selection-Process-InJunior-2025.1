            <h2>About his History...</h2>
            
            <p class="text-content">
                Born in Brunswick, Germany, in 1777, 
                Gauss was a descendant of a humble family. His notable achievements 
                have been recognized since his childhood, when an apocryphal account
                mentions that he was able to identify a calculation error in
                his father's tax accounting, clearly demonstrating his mathematical 
                aptitude.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-content">
                With the participation of his teachers and 
                the help of his devoted mother, at the age of 14 he received financial
                support to pay for his mathematics studies at the University of Göttingen, 
                where he could begin to make his first significant contributions to the 
                scientific community. It's first notable discovery was the realization 
                that it was possible to construct a regular polygon with 17 sides using
                only basic drawing instruments, namely a ruler and compass. The steps 
                involved in this feat, which at first glance seemed quite unimpressive, 
                would later inspire the author responsible for creating one of the most 
                fascinating fields of study in mathematics: Galois Theory.
